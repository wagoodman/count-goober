# count-goober

This is [not] a very important application --responsible for extracting numbers from sentences and replaces these numbers with their respective fibonacci number:

```bash
$ count-goober "Number eight! Your last chance to negotiate"
original sentence   : Number eight! Your last chance to negotiate
fibonacci(sentence) : Number thirteen! Your last chance to negotiate
```
*note: the 8th fibonacci number is 13*
